🛠️Configuring a home wireless router and an  enterprise-level wireless LAN controller (WLC)

In this project, I configured a wireless network using both a home wireless router and an 
enterprise-level wireless LAN controller (WLC). The goal was to implement WPA2-Personal and 
WPA2-Enterprise wireless security configurations and ensure wireless devices could securely 
connect and communicate. The process included configuring DHCP settings, creating and 
securing SSIDs, and validating client connectivity through ping and web access. This assignment 
helped reinforce my understanding of wireless standards, VLANs, and security mechanisms used 
in real-world enterprise networks.
